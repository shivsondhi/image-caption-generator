# Image Caption Generator
Generates image captions using an encoder-decoder model where the encoder is a CNN and the decoder is an LSTM unit. 

### README.md to be updated.

# Note - 
Needs some care and maintenance; I plan to make changes to the file structure and the import statements so that the project gets running again. There are several other aesthetic and orderly changes to be made too and I intend to make them as and when I find the time to! The project otherwise is exhaustive and has all the files (if not a few extra / unused ones as well). I fully intend on weeding these out and modeling this repository consistent with my others.
